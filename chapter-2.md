BELLA found her cousin sitting in an arm-chair, with the cloak still over her shoulders, and a face of ashy whiteness, the reaction of her excitement.

“My dear, how ill you look!” was her first exclamation. “Have you been out?”

“I went a little way into the shrubberies,” said Mrs. Damer; “but the day turned so cold.”

“Do you think so? We have all been saying what a genial afternoon it is: but it certainly does not seam to have agreed with you. Look at my boy: isn’t he a fine fellow? He has been out all day in the garden. I often wish you had a child, Blanchey.”

“Do you, dear? it is more than I do.”

“Ah, but you can’t tell, till they are really yours, how much pleasure they give you; no one knows who has not been a mother.”

“No; I suppose not.”

Mrs. Darner shivered as she said the words, and looked into the baby’s fat, unmeaning face with eyes of sad import. Mrs. Clayton thought she had wounded her cousin, and stooped to kiss the slight offence away; but she fancied that Blanche almost shrunk from her embrace.

“She must be really ill,” thought the kindly little Bella, who had no notion of such a thing as heart-sickness for an apparently happy married woman. “She ought to see a doctor: I shall tell Colonel Damer so.”

BELLA found her cousin sitting in an arm-chair, with the cloak still over her shoulders, and a face of ashy whiteness, the reaction of her excitement.

“My dear, how ill you look!” was her first exclamation. “Have you been out?”

“I went a little way into the shrubberies,” said Mrs. Damer; “but the day turned so cold.”

“Do you think so? We have all been saying what a genial afternoon it is: but it certainly does not seam to have agreed with you. Look at my boy: isn’t he a fine fellow? He has been out all day in the garden. I often wish you had a child, Blanchey.”

“Do you, dear? it is more than I do.”

“Ah, but you can’t tell, till they are really yours, how much pleasure they give you; no one knows who has not been a mother.”

“No; I suppose not.”

Mrs. Darner shivered as she said the words, and looked into the baby’s fat, unmeaning face with eyes of sad import. Mrs. Clayton thought she had wounded her cousin, and stooped to kiss the slight offence away; but she fancied that Blanche almost shrunk from her embrace.

“She must be really ill,” thought the kindly little Bella, who had no notion of such a thing as heart-sickness for an apparently happy married woman. “She ought to see a doctor: I shall tell Colonel Damer so.”

In another half-hour they were at her side together, urging her to take their advice.

“Now, my darling,” said the Colonel, when Mrs. Damer faintly protested against being made a fuss about, “you must be good for my sake. You know how precious you are to me, and how it would grieve me to have you laid up; let me send for Dr. Barlow, as your cousin advises. You were very much overcome by the long journey here, and I am afraid the subsequent excitement of seeing your kind friends has been too much for you. You do not half know how dear you are to me, Blanche, or you would not refuse such a trifling request. Here have I been, for five years, dearest, only looking forward from day to day to meeting my dear loving little wife again; and then to have you so ill as this, the first month of our reunion, is a great trial to me. Pray let me send for Dr. Barlow.”
But Mrs. Damer pleaded for delay. She had become chilled through being out m the shrubberies; she had not yet got over the fatigue of her journey; she had caught a cold whilst crossing from Havre to Folkestone: it was anything and everything but an illness which required medical attendance. If she were not better in the morning, she promised to make no opposition to their wishes.

So she forced herself to rise and dress for dinner.. She appeared there calm and collected, and continued so throughout the evening, talking with Mr. Laurence quite as much as with the rest of the company; and she went to bed at the same hour as the other guests of Molton Grange, receiving with her cousin’s good-night, congratulations on the evident improvement of her health.

“I cannot quite make out what has come to that cousin of yours, Bella,” said Harry Clayton to his wife„ as they too retired for the night; “she doesn’t appear half such a jolly woman as she used to be.”

“She is certainly very much altered,” was Mrs. Clayton’s response; “but I think it must be chiefly owing to her health; a feeling of debility is so very depressing.”

“I suppose it can’t be anything on her mind, Bella?” suggested the husband, after a pause.

“On her mind, Harry!” said Bella, sitting up in bed in her wonderment, “of course not; why, how could it be? She has everything she can wish for; and, I am sure, no woman could have a more devoted husband than Colonel Damer. He has been speaking a great deal about her to me to-day, and his anxiety is something enormous. On her mind!— what a funny idea, Harry; what could have put that in your head?”

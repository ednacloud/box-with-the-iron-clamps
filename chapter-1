MOLTON CHASE is a charming, old-fashioned country house, which has been in the possession of the Clayton family for centuries past; and as Harry Clayton, its present owner, has plenty of money, and (having tasted the pleasures of matrimony for only five years) has no knowledge (as yet) of the delights of college and school bills coming in at Christmas-time, it is his will to fill the Chase at that season with guests, to each of whom he extends a welcome as hearty as it is sincere.

“Bella! are you not going to join the riding-party this afternoon?” he said across the luncheon-table to his wife, one day in a December not long ago.

“Bella” was a dimpled little woman, whose artless expression of countenance would well bear comparison with the honest, genial face opposite to her, and who replied at once—

“No! not this afternoon, Harry, dear. You know the Damers may come at any time between this and seven o’clock, and I should not like to be out when they arrive.”

“And may I ask Mrs. Clayton who are the Damers,” inquired a friend of her husband, who, on account of being handsome, considered himself licensed to be pert, “that their advent should be the cause of our losing the pleasure of your company this afternoon?”
But the last thing Bella Clayton ever did was to take offence.

“The Damers are my cousins, Captain Moss,” she replied; “at least Blanche Damer is.”

At this juncture a dark-eyed man who was sitting at the other end of the table dropped the flirting converse he had been maintaining with a younger sister of Mrs. Clayton’s, and appeared to become interested in what his hostess was saying.

“Colonel Damer,” she continued, “has been in India for the last twelve years, and only returned to England a month ago; therefore it would seem unkind on the first visit he has paid to his relatives that there should be no one at home to welcome him.”
